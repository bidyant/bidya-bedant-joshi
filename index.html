            <p id="about_header">
             In a world filled with expectations and judgments, I've learned that being true to myself and following my passions leads to a fulfilling life. Seeking validation from others isn't my priority because I find joy in doing what I love. My inner compass guides me on a path filled with enthusiasm and contentment. Though it may not always be easy, embracing my authentic self has given me strength and courage to face challenges. I've come to understand that being myself is a valuable gift that brings genuine happiness.

            <p>
              Here, I am sharing my educational qualifications and degrees, which are considered essential in our society to be recognized as an educated person. But I think <b>Education</b> is like a journey from darkness to light. Being <b>Educated</b> is not about intelligence or the knowledge gained; it's more about how we treat our environment and the people in it.

                 Our family moved from Sosia to Dharmagad, where I spent a delightful decade completing my primary school education at SSVM Dharmagad. From kindergarten until 8th grade, I had the pleasure of making numerous friends and exploring every corner of the town. It was a memorable chapter in my life that left me with cherished memories and also I know every part of the town.

                <p>
                During my High School years, I resided as a hosteler at SSVM Brajavihar. Those two years were the best part of my life, where I met a remarkable teacher who taught me valuable life lessons and shared a meaningful mantra of 3D. Being a part of this wonderful institute filled me with immense pride, and I formed lasting connections with kind-hearted teachers and fellow students, maintaining contact through various social media platforms. I enjoyed my time, both in studies and life, and successfully completed my 10th class at this institute. Looking back, I treasure that journey and wish for the chance to relive those unforgettable moments.

                 For two years, I had a tough time at SSVM Nk.nagar. Although I loved Berhampur and its people, I didn't enjoy my stay at the +2 boys Hostel, which felt like a "central Jail" to the hostelers. However, I cherish the few friends I made during that period. Sometimes, I wish I could forget those two years and avoid going through such a tough time again. The reason for my unhappiness was that the institute didn't encourage us to do productive things or think about different topics. Everyone seemed focused only on marks and ranks, leaving little room for personal growth. I wish I could erase those two years from my life and avoid reliving such a distressing time.

                I have a deep passion for Physics, and it led me to embark on a fulfilling 3-year journey as a BSc Physics student at GMU. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, our classes initially shifted online, but we later resumed offline classes and engaging lab work in the 2nd year. One thing that stands out about the School of Physics at GMU is the amazing support from the teachers. They consistently encourage students to explore productive endeavors and think critically. Their emphasis is on understanding the concepts rather than memorization.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  During my 3-year BSc program, I delved into a wide array of fascinating subjects, including Mathematical techniques, Newtonian & classical dynamics, Electro dynamics, Special theory of relativity, Quantum mechanics, Nuclear & particle physics, Thermal physics & Statistical mechanics, Optics, analog & digital electronics, solid-state physics, and Nano Technology.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  I was selected as <b>class representative</b> in school of physics GMU for the 3 years. It was challenging one, but I accepted it. I have a deep love for research, rather than just studing physics.  I found immense joy in research, and as a result, I took the lead in organizing several science-based programs. Among these, I lead three project presentation programs within our department, showcasing innovative research by fellow students.

                  During my second year, I had a memorable experience with the <b>Analog Electronics project</b> under the guidence of <b>Prof. SK Das</b> in SCHOOL OF PHYSICS GMU. In a team effort, we worked on an <b>Audio amplifier project using OP-AMP from scratch</b>, managing to keep costs lower than industrial options by incorporating recycled materials.
                  <br>
                    <hr>
                 After completing the audio amplifier project under Prof. Das's guidance, I worked on an edutech project called <b>eGyanaVigyana</b>. This project aims to provide a comprehensive preparation package for undergraduate students targeting exams like IIT JAM, JEST, TIFR. Using Android with Java, I developed the app, However, as my final semesters and PG entrance exams were approaching, there were a few finishing touches and content upload part left. With Prof. Das's support, we are working diligently to add content and questions to the app before its launch on the Play Store.

                  In my 5th semester, I with my  project mates developed a low-cost, rechargeable battery operated <b>semiconductor laser</b> using waste products, as part of the <b>solid-state and device</b> chapter, and presented it during the project presentation session.

                  <hr>
                  In my final semester, I undertook the independent design of an electronic circuit based on SSHI and SECI techniques to <b>generate electricity from piezoelectric materials</b>, utilizing stress or pressure. With the guidance of <b>Dr. Pranti Purohit</b>, I worked with PhD scholar <b>Bomkesh sir</b> to build and test the circuit in our GMU physics Lab.

                 <p>
                   During the lockdown period when there was not much to do, my passion for learning led me to embark on a creative journey. I got the idea to create a <b>video game</b>, and although I had some basics of C programming learned at Brajavihar, I decided to dive deeper into coding. Starting with C, I used a smartphone with a C4droid compiler to begin my coding adventure. Soon, I progressed to C++, Java, and Python.
                   My first game, the "Friendship Calculator" (also an Android app), was born from my efforts in C language. Due to lck of high end pc I was unable to go with 3D game developemnt with Game engines. Throughout this journey, I had the invaluable guidance and support of my elder brother, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/prakashanand.musician"><b>Anand Prakash Joshi</b></a>, who is not only a software engineer but also a talented musician.

                <p>
                  I came to know about <b>Blogger</b>, a text-based blogging and content writing tool. At first, I was unsure about the topic to choose, so I started with Physics. However, my curiosity led me to explore the <b>HTML edit mode of Blogger</b>, and I began learning HTML from sources like YouTube and W3Schools. This ignited my passion for web development, and I delved into CSS, JavaScript, and backend development using PHP and Node.js. In this journy My High school teacher <b>Rudra guruJi</b> helped me alot.
                  <br><br>
                  With one year of web development experience, I found it more accessible than game development. I even created games using JavaScript. One of my web applications was <b>sold for Master's degree project</b> to a Pakistani college graduate . Along this journey, I also built this website. While I started learning the MERN stack, my college reopening in Sambalpur disrupted my progress, but the lockdown period allowed me to immerse myself in programming.

                <h4>Android App development</h4>
                <h5>2022 - 2023</h5>
                <p>
                 During my college days at GMU, my curiosity for different technologies was unstoppable. I devoted around 2-4 hours every midnight to learn and work on various projects after completing my study hours. Initially, I focused on React.js and Next.js, building web applications. However, while working on the eGyanaVigyana project, I became fascinated with <b>Android app development</b>.
                <br>
                  During the lockdown days, I had already gained knowledge of Java, which made learning Android development a smooth journey for me. I began with the basics, focusing on creating projects using the MVC architecture. As I progressed, I delved into advanced concepts like Work Manager, services, and multi-threading, enabling me to develop complex and feature-rich Android applications with ease.
                <br>
                  Diving into Android, I learned about the core concepts of the operating system, its life cycle, different architectures, real-time rendering, and Firebase integration. This deep exploration allowed me to create an edutech application for the School of Physics at GMU.
                <br>

                  After completing my BSc degree, I spent a month in Sambalpur, preparing for the CUET exam and finishing my piezoelectric project. During that time, I learned Kotlin since Google was favoring it over Java for Android development. As I already knew Python and Java, I quickly grasped Kotlin and coroutines.
                I began developing Android apps in Kotlin, and after completing my project, I returned to my village. That's when I started working on my dream project, the <b>'Growth Tracker App'</b>.
                  <br>
                  This app allows users to monitor plant growth and create captivating time-lapse videos. With a user-friendly interface and custom camera shutter button, users can capture images at their chosen time intervals, even when the app runs in the background. The app securely stores the images and compiles them into stunning time-lapse videos, making it a valuable tool for gardening enthusiasts, students, and nature lovers to document and visualize plant development. I created two versions using CameraX and Camera2 API.
                  <br>
                  During my free time, I continued learning Android by working on projects, and it has been an exciting journey of discovery and development.

                <h4>Photography & Videography</h4>
                <h5>2023 - present</h5>
                <p>
                  My photography journey began with my smartphone, which had a main camera, ultra-wide camera, and macro camera that captured amazing shots. During my college days, I took some pictures, but after completing my BSc, I had free time, so I started learning photography from various sources.
                <br>
                  <br>
                  I began by understanding basic camera settings like exposure triangle and how different lenses work. Then, I explored composition techniques like the rule of thirds and the golden ratio. As I mastered the <b>pro mode of my smartphone</b>, I learned to adjust aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and manual focus. I learned Lightroom for color correction and having prior knowledge of Photoshop, it was easier for me to grasp. I then dived into color grading in Premiere Pro, which opened up new possibilities for creating stunning short films. This way, I continued my journey of photography and videography, constantly exploring and improving my skills.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  To enhance my photography, I invested in a camera lens package from Adcom Technology, which included macro, wide-angle, fish-eye, and telephoto lenses along with a tripod. With these gadgets, I started exploring photography and relaunched 'Bidyant Sir ki Classes' as <b>'Electromagnetic Bytes'</b>. Now, in my free time, I thoroughly enjoy capturing the beauty of nature through my lens and store it in digital format bytes...
